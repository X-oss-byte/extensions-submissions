Yay! The extension [{{ .extension }}](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId={{ .extension }}) is valid :tada:.

Now, @docker/extensions will add the `publish/ready` label to the issue which will start the publishing of the extension on the marketplace.
Once published, this issue will be closed.

In the meantime, you can answer a couple of questions to tell us how your experience building a Docker Desktop extension was :smiley:: https://forms.gle/88SLHsn2Xb1BgMQ49.
