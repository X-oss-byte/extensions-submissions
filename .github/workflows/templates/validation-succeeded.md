:white_check_mark: The extension [{{ .extension }}]({{ .share_link }}) is valid :tada:.

Now, @docker/extensions will authorise the publication of the extension to the marketplace.
Once the extension is published, this issue will be closed.

In the meantime, please tell us about your experience building a Docker Desktop extension here: https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7184948/Publishers-Feedback-Form.
